## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in the OJS Go SDK,
please report it responsibly.

**Please do NOT open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

### How to Report

Email **security@openjobspec.org** with:

- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Any suggested fixes (optional)

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours of your report
- **Assessment**: Within 7 days we will provide an initial assessment
- **Resolution**: We aim to release a fix as quickly as possible, depending on complexity

### Disclosure Policy

We follow coordinated disclosure:

1. Reporter submits vulnerability details privately
2. We acknowledge and begin investigation
3. We develop and test a fix
4. We release the fix and publish a security advisory
5. Reporter may publish details after the fix is released

We appreciate your help in keeping the OJS ecosystem secure.
